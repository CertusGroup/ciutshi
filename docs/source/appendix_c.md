## ciuTshi in Action

data set - geonames

verify reqs
    verify terminology via workshop/talking throught he rationale
    identify value for project & organization
    verify finalized requirements and notify effects of drift
        knowledge gaps
        initial metric questions with associate metadata features
    determine roles to be filled as needed
    start documenting all essential content
    start documenting metadata metamodel for new asset

selection tms delegation
    review/pushback on requirements if needed
    define and clarify user stories
    review all modules needed for the asset
        verify with project & data leadership
    review critical quality assurance factors for new data asset
    initiate version control for any code artifacts
    review and mobilize storage practices for raw data asset

collection
    kickoff data management task for engineering team
        review modules as needed for metadata population
        fill out as much as possible, gaps are okay
    add to modules if gaps in process
        update is needed for consistent practices
    follow governance practices when policy issues arise
    add to content management as needed

modeling
    review initial metric questions to verify the requisite fields
    determine the model and its value impact
    determine model category
        is it a universal?
    determine model scope
        value, quality, etc.
    update documentation with model write-up
        proof needed
        attempt to identify/resolve non-ciuTshi metric links to organization
            bolster value proposition
    update version control

proof
    validity review sessions
        sanity checks
            understandable?
            cross-validated?
        internal review
            reproducible?
            transferable?
        peer-review
            tranferable?
    security checks
    ethics checks
