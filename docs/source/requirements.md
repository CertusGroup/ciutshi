# Requirements

In modern data work, it is imperative that decisions about, and for, data solutions be clearly defined. This definition clarification ensures that a customer is optimizing their infrastructure and data worker resources for rapid results and maximized return on investment (ROI). In order to realize these results and ROIs, certain practices must be available to the data team to clearly guide the requisite processes towards desired outcomes.

Data products are predicated upon a cycle of eliciting answers on the actual problematic and documenting this process to ensure precision [1](#references) throughout a given project for process lineage. This cycle will lead to selection and development of the most appropriate data models and data processes: not those that are simply desired or initially proposed. This differentiation is critical for on-going data practice improvements. Since data practices must be persistently analyzed and adjusted for validity and applicability within a given combination of project scopes, models, and data, requirement refinement must be the first step in a data project. This initial step will ultimately lead to improved quality and efficiency for data products and services.

This requirements guide is a simplified approach for requirements adapted from Agile developer operations (DevOps) [2](#references) and data-focused program management (PM) [3](#references). The rationale and objectives that follow are rooted in the practices of identifying errors in thought and processes while outlining risks associated with a given data-oriented approach. This supports parallel data operations efficiencies such as clear task management for personnel, accurate and precise documentation practices, and continuous version control of models, metadata, and data lineage.

### Challenge

There are several reasons why you would want to focus on gathering the best requirements possible prior to starting data work. First, requirements improve communication on data challenges between stakeholders. This critical step will define clear problem statements in a two-step process to refine requirements (e.g., a short form and long form for defining requirements). Second, requirements help delineate task delegation. Requirements help data team leadership in assignment of tasks, definition of timelines, and delivery of high-quality data products. Task delegation optimizes data taskings by reducing duplicate efforts. Third, requirements help scope task shift costs. Metrics and tracking of resources is critical in any data environment, spanning across various system architectures. Refinement of requirements is a key step in evaluation of support and resources in a manner that is cost effective and systemically streamlined. Fourth, clear requirements make space for your data team to truly innovate. The data team is frequently confronted with several technical and systemic challenges. Consolidating and optimizing requirements creates space and time to permit talented professionals to innovate around key challenges for project stakeholders.

### Goals

* Rapid response to project data requirements
* Enhance requirements documentation and metrics
* Reduce duplication of efforts
* Enhance data team integration
