# Task Management

Data-driven practices require consistent and rigorous task management (TM). Data-driven practices mobilize production of data services and enable people to enhance their efforts in support of an organization's data vision. The challenge is to realize this data vision through consistently improving practices from a solid baseline of data governance and data management standards.[1](task_management/references) These standards enable accurate representation of data processes and meaning while forwarding the evolution of specified personnel and technologies as business requirements shift. This shift necessitates a task management body of practices to ensure rapid reconfigurations from the baseline are possible while maintaining a quality of outputs consistent with the organization's strategic data vision. Otherwise, the lack of a task management body of practices or poor use of task management systems undermines the intent and output of data systems and a misappropriation of data worker efforts.

Recent literature [1,2,3,4](task_management/references) suggest a balance of existing and new practices to support structuring task management for data operations. In 2001, Agile emerged as an effort to guide consistent development practices which are adaptable and open to a broad set of applications.[5](task_management/references) As a result, methodologies like Scrum, and later systems like Kanban and Scrumban (among many others), shifted to more flexible implementations for developer task management.[6](task_management/references) In the domain of data operations[1](task_management/references), Agile is an expected standard which is often mobilized within more specific Developer Security Operations (DevSecOps)[7](task_management/references) practices. This approach leads to more responsive data governance systems [3](task_management/references) and an improved value for the associated organization. This combination of improved communication and organizational relationship via flexible data operations and data management facilitate effective data products and services delivery to stakeholders and organization decision makers.[2](task_management/references)

The task management component of data operations should adhere to best practices for an effective Agile-based systems. ciuTshi situates guidelines to encourage consistent and rigorous practices with maximum adaptability and rapid task shift. This framework also makes inclusion of more detailed DevSecOps and waterfall approaches possible for projects that fall within variable delivery deadlines. This modular approach to task management makes inclusion of newer methodologies simplified through pre-existing integrations with version control systems (VCS) and content management system (CMS) practices able to accommodate TM shifts. The TM practices described in following sections facilitate improved business requirements capture, baseline metrics for projects, and requirements shift over the course of a project.

## Challenge

* __Simplified Task Management__ - This ensures that multiple data projects adhere to consistent task management practices and that all data team members are familiar with practices.
* __Consistent Management Practices__ - Process efficacy and lineage are a key part of task management practices which ensures adaptations in this practices do not invalidate previous efforts.
* __Rigorous Requirements Processing__ - The simplified task management practices guide enforces rigorous and cyclical re-examination of business requirements from cradle to grave, documenting shifts in requirements and recording the process as a whole.
* __Timeline Projection__ - Delivery on schedule for a set of business requirements is a critical aspect of this system. Implementation of these practices makes prediction for initial and adjusted delivery dates possible, allowing data management, data operations, and project managers to adjust accordingly.
* __Develop Data Operations Metrics__ - The implementation of consistent and rigorous task management allows data operations and data managers to adjust practices and personnel in a timely and cost effective manner while streamlining justification for data architecture and IT system resources.

## Goals

* Simplify consistent task management
* Produce and examine requirement-driven tasks
* Produce and analyze task and project metrics
* Reduce deliverable timelines
* Improve communication on data-centric requirements
