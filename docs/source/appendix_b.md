# Appendix - Data Strategy

## Templates

These are forms and templates associated with building a data strategy. This streamlined approach to drafting a data strategy was derived from several sources[1,2,3,4,5](appendix_b/references). It is highly recommended that you collect as much data as possible in the course of developing a data strategy.

### Data Strategy Assessment - Participant Template

This document is a guide to collect key information points for the construction and drafting of an institution's data strategy.

Participation in this data collection process will be voluntary and participants must give their consent to the researcher so that their inputs on the following questions may be ethically included in the data strategy document.

The researcher may collect this data through any number of methods (e.g., interviews, open conversations, focus groups, response form, etc.) so long as the participants feel comfortable and able to submit their most complete answers to the questions. Considerations include selection of interview environment, time of day, or other factors that may optimize or enhance the interaction between researcher and participant.

The researcher may refer to the Interviewer Template for additional information on clarity and context of the questions during the collection process with the participant.

### Data Strategy Assessment - Interviewer Template

#### Background

Keeping up with the rapidly evolving data technology landscapes requires great efforts on the part of organizations. Data strategy is at the core of any successful data operations action plan[2](appendix_b/references). Data operations itself is a recent concept built upon several past information technology management (ITM) and data management (DM) efforts; popularized by Andy Palmer in 2015[5](appendix_b/references). In order for data operations to enable data management practices and optimizations, it must be situated within a vision and plan that make organizational transformation of data practices achievable. This requires an organization to cyclically audit and assess their current needs and future desires for data technologies that hierarchical align with upper-level institutions' visions, missions, and goals. As a result, defining and integrating a strategy for data operations is at the center of every data practice and each business requirement.

##### Rationale

In order to enable and persist research efforts in alignment with customer and stakeholder requirements, institutions must have a clear path from vision to action plan for their data operations and data management practices. This path is necessary to scope both personnel and data architectures for annual budgets and contract requirements processes. As a result, this scope must be reviewed and adapted persistently to ensure that an institution is mobilizing its resources to maximize its outputs and return on investment (ROI) in alignment its business strategies.

The ciuTshi data strategy process is derived and adapted from several sources to capture the current state of data operations and necessary evolutions that must take place in the coming fiscal years. This approach leverages situational analysis in order to garner a full-spectrum understanding of the data environment for institutional customers and stakeholders. This understanding will guide acquisition and deprecation of data architectures and assets for each fiscal year while accounting for potential challenges and innovative opportunities. This allows leadership to submit improved business requirements per project; broadening external engagement through more specific data operations language and data knowledge areas. This specificity opens dialogues that are more applicable to stakeholders and foster requirements that are rapidly achievable and deliverable to customers seeking improved contributions within their associated communities or practice.

##### Objectives

* Perform data strategy reviews every two years to enable adaption and evolution of data practices
* Align data operations to enable business strategies
* Enable data operations to improve data products and services
* Share lessons learned on data operations successes and challenges with customers and stakeholders

#### Method - Situational Analysis

Situational analysis is a method for assessment of current states for any number of environment factors[2](appendix_b/references). As derived from Harvinder Atwal's Data Ops works[2,5](appendix_b/references), situational analysis will focus on five key areas:

* __*Organization*__ - These questions focus on common and tacit knowledge associated with data operations' status, paradigms, and challenges.
* __*People*__ - These questions garner understanding on:
  * *Leadership* - How decision-makers use data products, services, and analytics.
  * *Teams* - Understanding roles, resource allocation, and personnel skills/retention.
* __*Technology*__ - These questions focus on current and planned data technology capabilities.
* __*Processes*__ - These questions capture the levels of data engineering, data analysis, and data science maturity.
* __*Data Assets*__ - These questions garner understanding of how the institution manages data, including accessibility and improvability.

> Note: Situational analysis should not seek to create solutions or objectives in the course of data collection and analysis. Its purpose is to make planning a strategy more robust; not to be the plan itself. This requires strict observation by the researcher for any cognitive biases or logical fallacies that may be presented by a particular question or data point.

Situational analysis can be paired with gap analysis to ensure institutional alignment of the data strategy with upper-level missions, goals and key performance indicators (KPI). The data strategy will then be:

* Defined and disseminated to leadership and the data team to ensure understanding and compliance.
* Implement the action plans and record metrics to ensure the implementation stays within data strategy scope and timeline
* Monitor and adapt the action plans as needed, ensuring shifts are reflected in the proceeding data strategy documents

What follows are the participant template questions and additional details to assist the researcher in collecting data points and expanding the participant inputs beyond the initial questions.

##### Ethical Research Statement and Consent

Ensure that any participants involved in the data strategy process give their consent and are aware of their right to withdrawal their contributions at any time. A statement such as the one below should be presented to and acknowledged by the participants prior to a session.

> This document is a guide to collect key information points for the construction and drafting of the data strategy. Participation in this data collection process will be voluntary and participants must give their consent to the researcher so that their inputs on the following questions may be ethically included in the data strategy document. The researcher may collect this data through any number of methods (e.g., interviews, open conversations, focus groups, response form, etc.) so long as the participants feel comfortable and able to submit their most complete answers to the questions. Considerations include selection of interview environment, time of day, or other factors that may optimize or enhance the interaction between researcher and participant. The researcher may refer to the rubric for additional information on clarity and context of the questions during the collection process with the participant.

### Data Strategy Assessment - Report Template

#### Introduction

This document describes the general data strategy report template. The vision, mission, and objectives that guide the data strategy will be outlined. These points will be followed by the planned operational model and a description of the necessary roles and responsibilities. Data operations will then be contextualized within the evolving state of institutional data architectures, culminating in the roadmap which broadly describes the incremental realization of the data strategy for the biennial report period.

> Note: More detailed, architecture-specific versions of this report may be drafted within other secure systems as required.

#### Operational Model

The operational model section covers the organization and team considerations for the data strategy period of performance. A primary consideration is that data operations must consolidate essential data governance challenges for improved data strategy definition and planning for the biennial report period.

##### Vision

The vision statement for the data strategy must encapsulate the necessary future state of the institution's data infrastruture for enhanced data asset management. This will support the broader vision, but from a technology and information systems perspective. The vision statement must also point to key groups or people whom benefit from, or are determinant of, the vision's implementation.

##### Mission

The mission statement for the data strategy establishes the current tasks undertaken by the institution's data professionals in support the data mission. This fulfillment model generally encompasses support of projects through collaborative efforts from ITM, data architecture, and data asset management personnel. Much like the vision, the mission will shift with the institution's project requirements and annual mission statement changes.

##### Objectives

The scope and scale of the data strategy mission covers several key objectives that must be addressed within the biennial report period. These must weave together the scales of data infrastructure with the need of data asset utilization across systems where metadata, metrics, and parity are critical to data operations practices.

##### Organizational Operations

The organizational operations section will establish alignment between data operations and the institution's mission, priorities, and goals. This section will improved clarity on how the operational model will aid alignment of data efforts toward overall organizational success.

#### People

The people section covers the data personnel considerations for the data strategy biennial period of performance.

##### Roles and Responsibility

This section should list key roles and subordinate roles essential to guidance and completion of data strategy objectives. Each role will include a list of primary resposibilities which distinguish the roles within the context of the proceding data strategy sections. This clarification on what roles achieve in the scope of mission, vision, and goals helps create a lexicon which reduces conflict between data teams while encouraging maximum collaboration between essential data personnel.

##### Talent and Skills

This section will list essential talents and skills seen as critical or essential for the completion of objectives during the biennial data strategy period. This may include hardware, software, organizational, educational, interpersonal, and any other category of skill or talent needed to acheive positive results toward the mission, vision, and institutional priorities.

#### Data Operations

The data operations section covers the data asset process considerations for the data strategy period of performance.

##### Data Governance

This section covers shifts in data governance as a core element of the data operations framework for guiding data management efficiencies. Shifts may cover changes to requirements processes, task management system practices, version control guidance, quality assurance practices, security updates, and revised ethics for data asset utilization. This has direct implications for the biennial strategy's handling of data availability, data access, and resource prioritization.

###### Data Lifecycle Management

This section covers the direct system-level considerations for the biennial data strategy. Data lifecycle management is the engine of data operations, buffered by data governance to allow data engineering personnel to excute requirements with increased efficiency. This covers changes to data storage, modeling, analytics, data integration, metadata, and cataloging of data assets from raw state to end-point delivery.

##### Trust and Security

The biennial data strategy should enable a strong link between operations and security. This includes bridging the gaps in trusted systems and personnel with the data infrastructure accesses that perpetuate efficient data asset delivery. Institutional and community factors should be acounted for as regulations and license agreements for both systems and assets can shift the security and trust paradigm for data operations customers and stakeholders.

##### KPIs and Metrics

KPIs and metrics will be a significant part of the data strategy as they help track outputs, outcomes, and value generation per process for internal customers and external stakeholders. This tracking makes future planning efforts simpler and more achievable as the vision increasingly integrates data requirements and task management practices.

#### Data Architecture

The data architecture section covers the data technology and data asset considerations for the data strategy period of performance. Data assets depend on data archictectures ability to facilitate assests per requirements to customer end-points. A large part of this relationship are the tools and technologies that support their management and governance within the organization's information systems.

##### Technology and Tools

This section covers essential considerations for maintenance and shifts in tools and technologies for data management. This includes software and programming languages essential to process and regulate data assets across systems. This focus ensures that the data strategy accounts for timelines to upgrades and license technologies in a manner that acheives continuity of data operations within and between strategy periods.

##### Architecture

This section covers essential considerations for cloud and on-prem data architecture resources. The data strategy requires careful observation of data architecture resources, their maintenance, and the metrics that dictate how these systems should shift between biennial planning periods. The manner at which these choices drive sustainable parity between data architectures on different information systems is at the core of this sections purpose. This consideration allows data asset governance and management to be more easily maintained and for portability of practice to customers and stakeholders.

##### Data Operations and Management Connections

This section covers the overlap between tools, architectures, and practices in data operations for asset management. The focus here should be on the management and security of data asset externalities in data operations. These elements can be subdivided into two initial areas of concern: lineage of acquisition and processing to mastered internal consumer data mart; export and delivery of practices and services to external stakeholders.

###### Internal Customer Data Mart

With data management buffered by data governance within broader data operation practices, data architecture should at a minimum facilitate internal access to search of data assets. This access should be permissable to expected organization security and access levels of the assets and systems. Once accesses are established, this section should define the manner in which internal customers can request support and additional dimensionality for project associated data services. Commonly, this service layer will center on data catalog and requirements elements of data operations.

###### Transition of Products and Services to External Stakeholder

With clearly defined delivery and deprecation standards obtained through the requirements practices, this section should focus on packaging practices for data assets and services from appropriately secure systems to external stakeholders as part of project completion. This includes additional features of quality assuarance and integration that must pass both organization and customer standards for final requirement fulfillment. The data strategy should account for any critical gaps in this set of practices to ensure essential revision and adoption of data operations practices within evolving data architectures.

#### Roadmap

This roadmap covers the cumulative path of actions to be taken during the biennenial data strategy period to realize the data operations' requirements outlined in above sections.

##### Action Plans toward Vision and Objectives

This section lays out the two year timeline for all elements of the data strategy. Though this plan may change per organizational shifts, the action plan must be pursued to its fullest extent possible. Each of the above sections will have their own set of action plans making tasking per roles more simple and equitable for the array of personnel skills available. This consideration for delegation across sections and personnel should be seen as an opportunity to review and revise both plans and indeation towards essential integration to the institution's vision and objectives for the expected years encompassed by the data strategy.

The organization may shift the format and systems through which action plans are conceived and executed. The core of the action plans utilization within the data strategy is in the consistent accountancy of critical shifts to any element of data asset management and governance. These considerations permit leadership to enable valuable feedback to data professionals regarding the strategy and the ultimate value delivered to the business model and the institutional array of customers and stakeholders.

## Rubric

The ciuTshi metamodel for metadata contains a set of baseline criteria. This can be adjusted based on the specific language or model metadata requirements. *Benchmarks* and *metrics* are flexible elements that can guide and enrich the metadata model for the institution's specific metadata needs.

* __*Benchmark*__ is the expected suitability measure or criteria for the metadata element.
  * *essential* elements are metric elements of information needed to ensure data retained in done so for measurable reason(s).
  * *non-essential* elements are elements that may not be relevant to the raw data asset of the institution in charge of the data asset.
  * *recommended* elements are recommended in cases where the raw data asset has set conditions upon it utilization or complexities in its interpretation.
* __*Metrics*__ is an extensible array of quantitative and qualitative features associated with the data asset element and can be augemented to suit an institutions metric requirements. *weight* is the only default feature in *metrics*
  * *weight* by default is set to `1` for each metadata element.
  * *field_category* has three variables: direct; indirect; and mixed measures.
    * Direct measures are first-hand data points collected by the research.
    * Indirect measures are second-hand sources used by the researcher.
    * Mixed measures are a combination of direct and indirect.
