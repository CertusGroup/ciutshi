# Appendix - Templates and Rubrics

## Appendix A. Methodology

ciuTshi makes adaptable data operations simple. Despite the size and complexity of this appendix (and the overall standard), building metadata and process value are incremental and cumulative efforts. The challenge of generating rich metadata for modeling and analysis is a team effort, shared by several persons in the organization for which the data provides value. The aim of ciuTshi is to make the connection between the data and its value to the organization clear and valid for its users. What follows is a brief overview of an adaptable methodology for using this standard to gather and generate data asset value metrics.

### Verification

ciuTshi starts its data operations journey through clear requirements for a data asset. If your institution does not have a clear need for a data set or collection, nor a good value proposition for using people and resources to process the data into useable endpoint, it is not needed. Begin by reviewing and verifying the requirements with project leads, leadership, and other stakeholders who may provide clarity on the intent and purpose for a data asset request. If there is a clear justification for tasking a data engineering team with acquisition and curation of the data asset, start using dimensions, features, and user stories for the data to conceive of metrics which can validate process value for the institution (e.g., How does the use of this data impact the project and organization? How do I show this impact to leadership, stakeholders, and non-technical personnel?).

> Note: This step is where knowledge gaps are also identified. Even if the data is not accessible or is non-existent, an effort should be made to note the gap and what value the data, if present, would provide the organization. This will leave an ontological marker for later data enrichment via proxy data assets and/or metrics.

### Selection

Every modular practice in ciuTshi has a template and rubric to facilitate eventual population of metadata for a data asset: creating data provenance for the organization's metadata lineage. This process is a team effort with several data professionals tasked to action one or more modules for a given data asset. To begin, review the module's documentation: summary, template, rubric, and any worksheets that assist in populating metadata for the data asset. Each module has roles, each with their own responsibilities and tasks that may depend on or overlap with other modules, tasks, and roles. A number of data professionals and organizational team members facilitate these task and modules by performing one or more roles within and between modules. This approach to task management within data operations allow organizations with variable available personnel to layer and delegate tasks within reasonable deadlines for both delivery of the data asset and population of the metadata.

> Note: This represents a situation common for many organizations and is why ciuTshi's metatdata model is so critical: the connection between metadata and the socio-technical space of data operations is full of critical metrics that lend to quantifying process value in data practices.

### Collection

Once requirements are validated and tasks are appropriately assigned, data professionals should collect and populate their portion of the metadata in the process of facilitating their data engineering, management, and governance tasks. All fields in the rubric schema should be filled out as completely as possible. It is understood that you may not use all the fields at first, but it is recommended that you maintain the entire schema as future data requirements may expand the scope of metadata needs. This also ensures that as ciuTshi grows, augmenting your existing metadata collections is simplified.

Additionally, metadata collection should observe existing scientific research practices in population of the metadata rubrics. It is important to not make up data: null elements or empty fields are acceptable inputs if sufficient data is unavailable. It is important that every member of the data operations team agree to the consistent manner in which data is collected and entered into the rubric: noting the agreed method in the content management documents for the data project. It is recommended that this consistent data collection across all modules be rigorously adhered to within and between data projects: the more consistent and rigorous the metadata collection is, and the better shifts in these practices are tracked, the more valid the metric model outputs may be for decision-makers, stakeholders, and customers. This ability to validate metrics with collection practices aids in cross-validated review of those metrics with others throughout the organization.

> Note: Not every organization will use the same parts of ciuTshi in the same ways. The key focus should be to perform metadata collection in a consistent, rigorous, and verifiable manner. This level of metadata quality assurance is critical for long-term review and verification of metrics for data operations.

### Modeling

In the requirements phase, we began asking critical questions to connect the data asset to its value impact for the project and as a result, the institution. After generating a rich and deep metadata collection for a data asset, we can now start adjusting and adding metrics to our fields for module- and asset-level modeling. Metrics are often organization specific, but may fall in several categories: descriptive, prescriptive, perceptive, interaction, outcome to name a few. Over time, each organization will develop and model their own sets of quantitative and qualitative metrics for their data assets. These metrics should be developed and documented as the organization's mission, vision, and goals shift: this helps leadership and stakeholders understand how value and impact change based on key indicators found in the metadata. Value should be at these metrics' loci, but it is by no means to only concern data professionals should have for a data asset. There may be quality, security, ethics, or other ensemble metrics derived from the organization's members, leadership, stakeholder networks, communities of practice, and other data partners.

There are also universals that exist across all data assets which add richness to the metadata for longitudinal analysis:

* __*weight*__ is a default metric that exists across all data elements. Weight can imply several things for a data asset and will be defined by each organization based on their core metric requirements for data lifecycle management (documented in detail via content management), but the initial intent for the metric is to determine how important a metadata field is for the organization (on a scale from 0 to 1). This variable heuristic weight allows each data asset to be shaped by data professionals to reflect their organization's unique application of data operations for value generation and stakeholder impact.

> Note: Outside of data operations, other institutional teams and sections may have metrics that do not adhere to ciuTshi standards for comprehensive metadata collection and modeling. Efforts should be made to account for any connections within these external metrics that have direct implications for data asset impact on overall process value. Despite the technical and complex nature of some metrics, a non-technical team member must be able to understand the output of the model, its value, and its implications for institutional impact.

### Proof

Establishment of models requires a persistent level of vigilance to ensure their validity. This validity requires several engagements with the model and its modelers to ensure the metrics prove what they claim to prove. This validation starts with a sanity check: does the model, metadata, metrics, and outputs make sense based on what we know about the data asset, its collection, and its utilization? Validation should then be socialized, opening communication with colleagues to ensure the model makes sense when walked-through the modeling process (observing appropriate security and other ethical research practices). Once internal colleagues review the model and validate its metrics, it may then call for peer-review with stakeholders and other reliable partners (preferably a mix of specialized professionals with domain knowledge and astute non-technical persons with keen interrogation skills and curiosity). 

If data, system, and other necessary accesses are possible for a reviewer, there are a baseline of questions that would aid in maintaining proof of a metric's validity:

* Are the results reproducible?
* Is the model transferable?
* Are the results cross validated?
* Is proof understandable?

These steps in the process of validation ensure that a model mobilizes metadata production and utilization, keeping data systems and those that leverage them in a persistent state of constructive flow. This flow makes the cumulative and iterative cycle of metadata generation a systematic part of the data operations culture for the organization and its many talented professionals.

#### GitFlow Process

There are several things to consider when setting up a repository for source code and documentation. These are a few of those consideration to establish ahead of linking VCS to TMS and other data operations practices:

* What is the repository naming convention?
  * Is there a `project digraph + tool name` convention or something else?
* Do you have a standard Readme template to capture essential elements of information?
  * Title
  * Description
  * Installation instructions
  * Usage instructions and limitations
* Do you have a `docs` directory convention?
  * Are you using Sphinx or another static site generator?
* Is there a Wiki in or connected to the repository?
* How are source code and documentation issues tracked?
* What license model is being used for the source code?
* Are there contribution guidelines for members of the project?
  * Is there instructions for member on workflow practices?
  * Is peer or mob coding practices used? If so, how?

#### Repository Template

The goal of using a standard repository template is maximum reuse of well-documented code and methods.

An example of this template is as follows (from the top of the repository):

* .gitignore
* README.md
  * Links/locations to CMS on information system(s)
* LICENSE.md
* CONTRIBUTING.md
* SECURITY.md
* data_ops
  * README.md
  * CONTRIBUTING.md
  * docs
    * requirements
      * README.md
    * task_management
      * README.md
    * methods_research
      * README.md
    * quality_assurance
      * README.md
    * images
      * README.md
  * data_management
    * storage

      * pipelines
    * modeling
      README.md
    * analysis
      README.md
    * integration
      README.md

For each DMS section associated with code or tool methods, source folder content should maintain this baseline:

* models
  * model_a
    * README.md
    * source
    * tests

  * *non-essential* elements are elements that may not be relevant to the raw data asset of the institution in charge of the data asset.
  * *recommended* elements are recommended in cases where the raw data asset has set conditions upon it utilization or complexities in its interpretation.
* __*Metrics*__ is an extensible array of quantitative and qualitative features associated with the data asset element and can be augmented to suit an institutions metric requirements. *weight* is the only default feature in *metrics*
  * *weight* by default is set to `1` for each metadata element.

## Appendix N. Cataloging

### Templates

These are questions associated with cataloging of data. It is highly recommended that you collect all essential elements if possible in the course of data management practices for data cataloging.

* Who manages data cataloging practices and personnel for the data asset?
* Who assists the primary data catalog manager (if exists)?
* Who is the counsel that advises on the legal limits for use of a cataloged metadata or master data samples?
* Who is the team that supports the data manager and/or deputy data manager?
* Who is the engineer that supports the data catalog management?
* Who owns the master data sample?
* Who is the steward that moves the master data sample to the data manager?
* What annotations are associated with the cataloged data record?
* What feedback method(s) are available for the data sample and associated metadata entry?
* What is the monitoring plan for the data catalog?

### Rubrics

The ciuTshi metamodel for metadata contains a set of baseline criteria. This can be adjusted based on the specific language or model metadata requirements. *Benchmarks* and *metrics* are flexible elements that can guide and enrich the metadata model for the institution's specific metadata needs.

* __*Benchmark*__ is the expected suitability measure or criteria for the metadata element.
  * *essential* elements are metric elements of information needed to ensure data retained in done so for measurable reason(s).
  * *non-essential* elements are elements that may not be relevant to the raw data asset of the institution in charge of the data asset.
  * *recommended* elements are recommended in cases where the raw data asset has set conditions upon it utilization or complexities in its interpretation.
* __*Metrics*__ is an extensible array of quantitative and qualitative features associated with the data asset element and can be augmented to suit an institutions metric requirements. *weight* is the only default feature in *metrics*
  * *weight* by default is set to `1` for each metadata element.
